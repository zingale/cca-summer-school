# First-Order Accurate Time Update

Let's start with a first-order update in time.  We can use the basic Euler
method:

$$\frac{\partial \langle a \rangle}{\partial t} \approx \frac{\langle a\rangle^{n+1} - \langle a\rangle^{n}}{\Delta t}$$

in which case our update appears as:

$$\langle a\rangle_i^{n+1} = \langle a\rangle_i^{n} - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} (F_{i+1/2}^n - F_{i-1/2}^n)$$

We expect this to be first order accurate in time.  Notice that the
fluxes are evaluated at the old time---this method is *explicit*.


## Reconstruction and the Riemann problem

We need the value of the flux on the interface, $F_{i+1/2}$, we find this using the analytic expression
for the flux, $F(a)$, as:

$$[F(a)]_{i+1/2} = F(a_{i+1/2})$$

So now we need to find the interface state, $a_{i+1/2}$.  

```{note}
Getting the value of $a$ on the interface from the average, $\langle a
\rangle$ is called *reconstruction*.  It means we need to infer how
$a$ actually varies throughout the cell just from the information we
have about its average value.  
```

There are a variety of methods we can
use (some of which we will explore later).  For now, we will do the
simplest, and assume that $a(x)$ is constant in each cell:

$$a_{i+1/2,L} = \langle a\rangle_i^n$$
$$a_{i+1/2,R} = \langle a\rangle_{i+1}^n$$

Notice that we actually have 2 values for the interface state when we
do this, one coming from each side of the interface&mdash;we label
these as the left and right states:

![left and right states for advection](riemann-adv-mol.png)

Now we need to resolve this degeneracy&mdash;which of the two states
(or what combination of them) is the correct interface state?  This is called the
*Riemann problem*.

```{note}
The Riemann problem is where the physics of the actual set of equations
comes into play.  Thus far, everything we've done has been general.
```

For advection, the Riemann problem is easy.  We know that for 
$u > 0$ that $a(x)$ moves
from left to right, so the correct state on the interface is the left
state&mdash;this is upwinding.

$$
a_{i+1/2} = \mathcal{R}(a_{i+1/2,L}, a_{i+1/2,R}) = 
\left \{ 
\begin{array}{c}
 a_{i+1/2,L} \quad u > 0 \\
 a_{i+1/2,R} \quad u < 0 
\end{array}
\right .
$$

where we indicate the Riemann problem as
$\mathcal{R}(a_{i+1/2,L},a_{i+1/2,R})$.

For the advection equation, with $u > 0$, our interface states are 

$$F_{i+1/2} = F(a_{i+1/2}) = u a_{i+1/2} = u \langle a \rangle_i$$

$$F_{i-1/2} = F(a_{i-1/2}) = u a_{i-1/2} = u \langle a \rangle_{i-1}$$

Inserting these into our difference equation, we have:

$$\langle a \rangle_i^{n+1} = \langle a \rangle_i^n - \frac{u \Delta t}{\Delta x} (\langle a \rangle_i^n - \langle a \rangle_{i-1}^n)$$
