# Measuring Convergence of our Euler Solver

We measured convergence with advection by comparing to the exact
solution.  But what about the case when we don't know the exact
solution?  We can use a grid convergence study to assess the
convergence.  Here's how it works.

1. Pick a smooth problem -- a good problem is the acoustic pulse
   described in this paper:

   [A high-order
   finite-volume method for conservation laws on locally refined
   grids](https://msp.org/camcos/2011/6-1/p01.xhtml)

   See section 4.2.  You'll do this in 1-d in our solver with periodic
   BCs.

2. Run the problem at 4 different resolutions, each varying by a
   factor of 2, e.g., 32, 64, 128, and 256 zones.

3. Compute an error between the run with N zones and the run with 2N
   zones as follows:

   * Coarsen the problem with 2N zones down to N zones by averaging
     2 fine zones into a single coarse zone.  This is shown below:

     ![restriction from a fine grid to a coarse grid](fvrestrict.png)

     Here, $\phi^f$ is a variable on the finer resolution grid and
     $\phi^c$ is the variable on the coarse grid.  We see that $\phi^c_j$
     has two fine grid counterparts: $\phi^f_i$ and $\phi^f_{i+1}$, so
     we would do:

     $$\phi^c_j = \frac{1}{2} \left ( \phi^f_i + \phi^f_{i+1} \right )$$

   * Compute the $L_2$-norm of the difference between the
     coarsened 2N zone run and the N zone run.

   * Do this for all pairs, so for the 4 runs proposed above, you'd
     have 3 errors corresponding to 64-128, 128-256, and 256-512.

4. Plot the errors along with a line representing ideal 2nd order convergence.
