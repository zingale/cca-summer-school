# HLL Riemann Solver

We solved the Riemann problem for the Euler equations exactly, but
many times in practice we use approximate Riemann solvers.  The HLL
solver is a popular solver.  Research this method and implement it in
the Euler code and compare the solutions you get with it to those with
the exact solver.

A good place to start is in the paper [The HLLC Riemann
solver](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00193-019-00912-4)
by E. F. Toro.  That summarizes the HLL solver and the more accurate
HLLC solver.
