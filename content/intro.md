This is a collection of notebooks on writing a simple finite-volume
solver for compressible hydrodynamics.  The goal is to understand
the basic structure of a hydrodynamics code.  We'll write solvers
for:

* linear advection
* compressible Euler equations


The methods we will discuss are at the core of many community astrophysics simulation
codes.
